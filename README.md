# IOSAdvancedTest

**This project is for the advanced ios module of the keepcoding bootcamp using a Dragonball api**

What have i do:
  - Animated splash with lottie
  - When login I save the token with **Keychain**
  - If the token is saved whe dont need to login if we close the app (The token never expires in this api)
  - When we get the characters, we save it with **CoreData** to dont do the api call the next time
  - Character detail with the location in a map
  - Log out button that remove the token and the saved data
  - Added a TabBar to navigate between the list and the map with all the characters locations

# TODO:
  - Save the locations too
  - When you press the location navigate to the characterDetail
